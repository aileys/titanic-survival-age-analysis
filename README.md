# Titanic Survival Age Analysis

This project analyzes the relationship between **passenger age** and **survival outcomes** on the RMS Titanic. Using Python, I compute descriptive statistics (mean, median, range), survival percentages, and visualize age distributions for both survivors and non-survivors.

This project demonstrates Python data analysis skills, statistical thinking, and data visualization techniques.

## 📊 What the Script Calculates

### ✔ Basic Passenger Statistics
- Total passengers with recorded ages  
- Average age  
- Youngest and oldest passengers  

### ✔ Survival Statistics
- Percentage of passengers who survived  
- Percentage of passengers who died  

### ✔ Grouped Age Statistics
For both **survivors** and **non-survivors**:
- Mean age  
- Median age  
- Age range  

### ✔ Visualizations
The script plots:
- **Age distribution of survivors**
- **Age distribution of passengers who died**

These appear as histograms using Matplotlib.
